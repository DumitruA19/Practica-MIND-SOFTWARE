- Full database scripting: `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER`, `INSERT`, `CONSTRAINTS`, `SEQUENCES`, `TRIGGERS`.
- Advanced SQL and PL/SQL consolidation exercises:
  - Data extraction with complex queries: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `SUBQUERIES`, `ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS`.
  - Window queries using `OVER(PARTITION BY...)`.
  - Use of advanced SQL functions: `RANK()`, `ROWNUM`, `CASE`, `NVL`, `DECODE`.
- Stored procedures and PL/SQL functions.
- Performance testing and query optimization.
